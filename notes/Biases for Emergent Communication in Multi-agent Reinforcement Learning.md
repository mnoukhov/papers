# Biases for Emergent Communication in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning

## overview

- improve on RIAL with auxiliary losses for agents to enable better communication
- positive signalling using MI of sent message and trajectory
- positive listening using CIC [(Jaques et al, 2019)](:note:db0ae1ff-a3a8-4d80-8743-95bf95912b60): MI of previously received messages and trajectory taken
