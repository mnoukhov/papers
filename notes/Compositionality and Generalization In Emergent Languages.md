# Compositionality and Generalization In Emergent Languages

## overview

- two new measures of compositionality for generalization
  - bag of symbols disentanglement
  - position disentanglement
- generalization happens when input space is sufficiently large 
- compositionality isn't necessary for generalization but sufficient
- compositionality is more easily learnable
