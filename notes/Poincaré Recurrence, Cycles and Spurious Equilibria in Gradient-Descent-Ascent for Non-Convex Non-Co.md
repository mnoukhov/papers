# Poincaré Recurrence, Cycles and Spurious Equilibria in Gradient-Descent-Ascent for Non-Convex Non-Concave Zero-Sum Games

## overview

- sgd doesn't always solve zero-sum games
- cycles and spurious equilibria exist
- using fancy maths 
  - poincaré reccurence
  - energy conservation
  - stable-center manifold theorem
