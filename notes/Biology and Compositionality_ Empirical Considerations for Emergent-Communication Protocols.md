# Biology and Compositionality: Empirical Considerations for Emergent-Communication Protocols

## overview

- compositionality does not make sense as a target for emergent communication if we consider biology/anthropology
- we should instead focus on reflexivity which has a simple proto form

## biology

there is not evidence for _human_ proto-compositionality
- all empirical evidence of proto-compositionality in nature comes from various species of old-world monkeys
- if proto-compositionality exists, it should have kinda been in our latest common ancestor (LCA)
- but no other monkeys/apes have compositionality so likely our LCA didn't have it either
- therefore proto-compositionality abilities of other monkeys evolved independently of humans

since monkey syntax is not a pre-cursor to human syntax, we have no evidence for human proto-compositionality

## vs Chomsky

if we want to learn compositionality over time then we want something that has a proto- form and so maybe we shouldn't try to learn compositionality

## reflexivity

if we want gradually learned natural language behaviour then maybe we want something like reflexivity that has bootstrapping
